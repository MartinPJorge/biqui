# BiQui
BiQui is a binary search algorithm based on queuing theory approximations
for V2N offloading and scaling. Using BiQui for scaling and offloading
results into minimizing objective functions as
 1. cost
 2. energy
 3. average delay
while meeting the e.g. 99.999 reliability constraint of V2N services.
That is, with BiQui you ensure that 99.999% of the times a vehicle
will experience V2N latencies below e.g. 100ms.
